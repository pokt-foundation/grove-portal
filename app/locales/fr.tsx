        question: "What is the Pocket Portal -fr?",
        answer:
          'The Pocket Portal is a browser-based interface where developers can create ("mint") a Pocket endpoint for use in their applications, utilizing a generous free tier of relays and scaling up as needed. Portal users can also monitor network performance.',

        answer: (
          <>
            The Pocket Portal currently supports creating an endpoint for dozens of
            chains, including Ethereum, Harmony, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fuse, and{" "}

      {
        question: "How can this be free? -fr",
        answer: `The Pocket Network provides bandwidth to decentralized applications that stake POKT. For the Pocket Portal's free tier, the Pocket Network Foundation has staked POKT on behalf of anyone who signs up to the Portal for up to ${FREE_TIER_MAX_RELAYS.toLocaleString(

        question: "How many endpoints can I create? -fr",

          "The Pocket Portal currently allows a user to create blockchain-specific endpoints for any chain served via the Portal. These endpoints can each be monitored as a single Application allowing for cross-chain analytics.",
      },
      {
        question: "Whatâ€™s the difference between an Application and an Endpoint? -fr",
        answer:
          "The Portal organizes relay traffic through Applications, which are collections of relay traffic. An Application can consist of one or more endpoints, which are URLs that can receive RPC requests to a blockchain. A Portal account can contain multiple Applications, which can in turn contain multiple endpoints.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long can I use the free option? -fr",
        answer: `Currently, the Foundation is operating with "good faith" guidelines, meaning that as long as you are actually using the service as intended, you can use the free tier for as long as you'd like. Our goal is to allocate this to developers who truly want to use and improve the service and grow their user base, so if you are not using the service, we reserve the right to withdraw the endpoint in order to reallocate it to another development team.`,
